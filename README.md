# Introduction <a name="introduction">

An internal security audit assessment done on Botium Toys, a fictitious toy company, completed as part of my cybersecurity portfolio and as part of Google's <a href='https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate'>Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</a> on Coursera in the  <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks?specialization=cybersecurity-certificate'> Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks </a> Course .
   
The goal is to perform an audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The audit needs
to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The
audit is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are
classified as “high risk,” and present an overall strategy for improving the security
posture of the organization. The audit team needs to document their findings, provide
remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.

# Scenario  <a name="scenario">
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the **National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework** (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture. The IT manager wants to use the audit findings as evidence to obtain approval to expand his department.

------------------------


The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:
- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF)
- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant
- Fortify system controls
- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential
management
- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks
- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

   
## Internal Security Audit Workflow  <a name="workflow">
The internal security audit can be broken down into two parts each with their own steps to follow.

### Part 1
1. Analyze the audit scope, audit goals, and risk assessment
2. Conduct the Audit
   - Complete Controls assessment 
     - Select controls needing to be implemented.
     - Rate each selected control on prioirty (i.e. needing to be implemented immediately or in the future).
   - Complete Compliance checklist
     - Explain why selected compliance regulations and standards need to be adhered to.
### Part 2
1. Review results and deliverables completed in Part 1, Step #2
   - make note of findings
   - consider how to summarize your recommendations clearly and concisely to stakeholders. 
2. Send findings and recommendations to stakeholders in a concise format

Compliance checklist
====================

To review compliance regulations and standards, read the [controls, frameworks, and compliance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/supplement/xu4pr/controls-frameworks-and-compliance) document.
   
I found that Botium Toys will need to adhere to the following standards:
     
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  -  GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens' data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen's data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.
      -  Botium Toys is expanding to offer services and handle the data of customers abroad, GDPR compliance is in scope for the handling of financial and personal information for customers in the European Union.
   

  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
  -  PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. 

       - Botium Toys must adhere to PCI DSS as it accepts payments online and person and They also store and processes customer credit card on an international scale. It's requirements and compliance need to be taken seriously based on possible consequences. The consequences of not complying with this standard is more severe in impact: Monetary fines monthly (ranging from 5,000-100,000 USD), costs of forensic audits upon a data breach, payment brand restrictions, damage to brand reputation, and possibility of lawsuit costs in the event of data breaches. 


  System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)
   - The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization's financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

      - Botium Toys needs to establish and maintain appropriate user access for internal and external (third-party vendor) personnel to mitigate risk and ensure data safey.
      - Both of these standards evaluate the effectiveness of a company's internal controls. While SOC1 I focused on financial reporting controls, SOC2 is concerned with information security controls, including customer data safety.

# Conclusion <a name="conclusion">

The findings of this audit highlight several critical areas requiring immediate attention to strengthen Botium Toys’ security posture and compliance. Implementing the recommendations will not only address the current vulnerabilities but also enhance the overall resilience of the organization against potential threats.

I recommend prioritizing the control gaps and physical security enhancements to align with industry standards and ensure robust protection for the organization’s assets and data.

This would complete my mock security audit writeup. I hope you find it helpful! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know.

Self-Evaluation: I’m confident I identified the key controls and compliance needs for Botium Toys. The assignment was a great way to apply what I've learned.

Lessons Learned:

I struggled with providing detailed findings in the stakeholder memo. I worked hard to be clearer and more concise, using lists and proofreading my work.

I also had difficulty explaining how the System and Organizations Controls standard impacts user access and overall data safety, beyond just financial aspects.
